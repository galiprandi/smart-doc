# Architecture Overview

System goals
- Provide a reliable, scalable, and maintainable platform.
- Facilitate onboarding for new contributors with clear module boundaries.
- Ensure observability and operational readiness.

Constraints
- Containerized deployments with clear module boundaries.
- Clear separation of concerns between frontend, API, and domain services.
- Emphasis on simple, observable runtime behavior and recoverability.

Logical components and responsibilities
- TBD: Replace with actual components derived from codebase.
- Frontend/Client: TBD
- API Gateway or Edge: TBD
- Domain Services: TBD
- Data Persistence: TBD
- Integrations: TBD

Data flow and integration points
- Client → API Gateway → Service(s) → Data Store
- Services may publish to a queue and consume from external APIs
- Caching layer sits between services and the datastore to optimize reads

Deployment/runtime context
- Containerized services; deployment mechanism TBD (Docker Compose, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Configuration via environment variables with a note on secrets management

Operational concerns
- Config and secrets: TBD
- Observability: TBD (logs, metrics, traces)
- Scaling: TBD (auto-scaling policies, capacity planning)
- Backups: TBD (backup strategy, retention)

Notes
- TBD: Fill in the actual components, data flows, and operational practices once the codebase structure is known.
