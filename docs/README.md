# Smart Doc — Documentation

This folder hosts Smart Doc’s internal documentation. This commit introduces `AGENTS.md` at the repository root with clear guidance for AI agents (and humans) contributing to this project.

- Agent contributors: see `AGENTS.md` for guardrails, scope, and editing guidelines.
- Docs scope: change‑driven, English‑only, minimal churn.
- Output location: generated pages live under `docs/`.

TODO: Expand module and architecture docs as code changes introduce or modify components.
