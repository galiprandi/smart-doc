# Smart Doc — Documentation Index

Last updated: 2025-09-21T05:29:20Z

This directory contains concise, change-driven documentation generated to reflect the repository layout and runtime behavior.

Files:
- `architecture.md` — high-level architecture and runtime flow
- `modules.md` — description of key scripts and modules
- `stack.md` — runtime, dependencies, and inputs

Refer to the repository root for primary action and prompts:
- `action.yml` — Action inputs and permissions
- `smart-doc.sh` — minimal entrypoint orchestration
- `prompts/` — prompt templates used by the generator

Usage
- Docs are intended to be change-focused and idempotent.
- If you modify code or workflows, re-run the generator to update these pages.
