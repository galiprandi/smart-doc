# Stack and Tooling

- Languages/Runtimes: Node.js (as per repo signals), Bash scripts for orchestration.
- Build/Test: Local doc-generation relies on Codex CLI; CI uses the smart-doc action.
- External services: OpenAI Codex API via `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `INPUT_SMART_DOC_API_TOKEN`.
- Environment: Ubuntu-based runner; Docker guidance available in repo.

- Notes:
- This file documents current tooling visible in the touched changes. It is intentionally small to avoid drift.
