# Technical Debt / TODOs

Last updated: 2025-09-21T16:57:33Z  (commit `254105f`)

No `TODO`/`FIXME` markers were found in the codebase at scan time. If you add `TODO` or `FIXME` comments to source files, re-run the documentation update to surface them here with file and line references.

Source scan command used: `rg "TODO|FIXME|@todo|# TODO|// TODO|/\* TODO" -n`
