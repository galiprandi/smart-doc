# Smart Doc â€” Force Run Marker

This file exists solely to trigger the Smart Doc GitHub Action on pushes to `main`.

- It is safe to keep in the repository; it does not affect documentation content.
- You can amend this file with a timestamp or a short note when you want to force a run.

Notes:
- The workflow ignores changes under `docs/` and `SMART_TIMELINE.md`, so touching this file guarantees a run.
- Remove or keep as you see fit; it is intentionally minimal.
