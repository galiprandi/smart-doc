ðŸš€ Smart Doc â€” Social Copy (ready to paste)


## LinkedIn


ðŸ“š Smart Doc: Keep shipping â€” weâ€™ll handle the docs. Smart Doc turns every merge into changeâ€‘only pages in /docs and a readyâ€‘toâ€‘merge PR.


We built Smart Doc, a GitHub Action that turns each merge into clear, changeâ€‘only docs â€” and opens an autoâ€‘merge PR so protected branches stay protected.


âœ¨ Highlights

- Changeâ€‘only updates to /docs (English, concise)

- Autoâ€‘merge PR instead of pushing to main

- SMART_TIMELINE.md replaces adâ€‘hoc changelogs for docs

- Works with any stack; easy setup (2 lines in your workflow)
