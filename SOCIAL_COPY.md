Title: Ship code and let your docs follow — automatically.

We built Smart Doc, a GitHub Action that turns each merge into clear, change‑only docs — and opens an auto‑merge PR so protected branches stay protected.

Highlights
- Change‑only updates to `/docs` (English, concise)
- Auto‑merge PR instead of pushing to `main`
- SMART_TIMELINE.md replaces ad‑hoc changelogs for docs
- Works with any stack; easy setup (2 lines in your workflow)

Get started
- Repo: https://github.com/galiprandi/smart-doc
- Use: `uses: galiprandi/smart-doc@v1`

Blog / Post (short)
Smart Doc keeps your documentation in lockstep with your code. It reads your diff, updates only what changed, adds diagrams when helpful, and proposes the update as a PR with auto‑merge — perfect for protected branches.

Add it to your repo in minutes: `uses: galiprandi/smart-doc@v1`.
