You are Smart Doc running in a controlled dev test.

Goal
- Verify end-to-end write path by creating a deterministic file under docs/.

Strict output contract (patch only)
- Respond ONLY with a single workspace patch in the exact format below to create/overwrite `docs/dev_demo.md`.
- Do not include any extra commentary.

Patch template (fill in the timestamp):

*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: docs/dev_demo.md
# Dev Demo

This is a deterministic test file generated by Smart Doc dev run.

- Timestamp (UTC, ISO8601): {{now_utc_iso}}
- Note: This file is only for local development verification.

  Dev((Dev)) --> SmartDoc[Smart Doc]
  SmartDoc --> Docs[(docs/)]
```
*** End Patch

Rules
- Replace `{{now_utc_iso}}` with the current UTC timestamp in ISO8601 format.
- Do not modify any other files.
- Do not output anything besides the patch.
